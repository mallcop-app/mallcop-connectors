// ACR maps a single Azure Container Registry ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents
// row (surfaced via the acr-diag-to-law diagnostic setting on
// acrnostrrelayprod, nostr-relay's infra/prod.bicep, mallcoppro-29f) to a
// canonical mallcop event.
//
// Why this exists: the image running the relay (acrnostrrelayprod's
// nostr-relay-prod repository) IS this system's software supply chain — a
// push replaces what's deployed exactly the way a new npm/pip dependency
// replaces code that runs. ACR's diagnostic log does not emit this to the
// subscription/RG-scoped Activity Log (mallcoppro-f8d's connectorPrincipalId
// grant covers that); it is its own data-plane category
// (ContainerRegistryRepositoryEvents), queried by cmd/acrpush.
//
// This connector queries ONLY OperationName in ("Push", "Delete") — Pull and
// other read-shaped operations carry no supply-chain-mutation signal and are
// filtered out server-side in the KQL (see cmd/acrpush's kqlQuery), so they
// never reach this function. Both operations are mapped to the SAME Type,
// "dependency_add", byte-identical to
// mallcop/core/detect/dependency_tamper.go's depTamperEventTypes map key and
// its Rule 4 literal (`ev.Type == "dependency_add"`) — a Type any other
// spelling ("dependency-add", "DependencyAdd", ...) would silently never
// reach that gate. Push and Delete share one Type deliberately: this gate's
// job is "did the artifact that runs the relay change," and both operations
// answer yes; only Push sets Direct so dependency_tamper.go's Rule 4 ("new
// direct dependency added") fires on the write that actually replaces running
// code, while a Delete still reaches Rules 1/2/5 and the type-less detectors
// (unusual-timing, volume-anomaly, new-actor) without producing a Rule-4
// false positive for content leaving the registry.
