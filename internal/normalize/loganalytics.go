// LogAnalytics maps a decoded relay_security structured log line (emitted by
// the nostr-relay's internal/seclog package, mallcoppro-813, and surfaced via
// Azure Log Analytics ContainerAppConsoleLogs_CL — cmd/loganalytics) to
// canonical mallcop events.
//
// decision/pubkey/remote/domain/detail are the five relay_security fields
// (see nostr-relay's internal/seclog/seclog.go doc comment: "{"msg":
// "relay_security","decision":<decision>,"pubkey":<pubkey>,"remote":<remote>,
// "domain":<domain>,"detail":<detail>}"). The decision literals below are
// byte-identical copies of nostr-relay's seclog.Decision* constants (verified
// against internal/seclog/seclog.go 2026-07-21) — this package cannot import
// that module (separate repo/module), so the strings are duplicated here
// rather than shared.
//
// mallcoppro-f1a RE-SCOPE: this connector previously ingested EVERY
// relay_security decision, including rate_limited / nip09_tombstone /
// balance_gate_rejected — those are USAGE/billing signals (a paying client
// hit its rate cap, a paid tombstone was accepted, a request was rejected
// for insufficient balance), not infrastructure subversion, and produced
// noisy findings a security operator has no action to take on. This
// connector now maps ONLY the two AUTHORIZATION-BOUNDARY signal families:
// (1) nip86_admin_call, narrowed further to just the write-allowlist
// GRANT/REVOKE methods (allowpubkey/banpubkey) — someone changing WHO may
// write to the relay; (2) unauthorized_writer (and, defensively,
// nip42_auth_failure — see below) — a non-admitted pubkey trying to write
// or authenticate and being rejected, framed as allowlist-breach probing.
// rate_limited, nip09_tombstone, and balance_gate_rejected now produce NO
// Result at all (see the decision switch below) rather than a CatchAll
// pass-through, so this connector's output is exclusively
// authorization-boundary events.
//
// decisionNIP42AuthFailure is defined in seclog.go but NOT currently wired to
// any call site in the relay (mallcoppro-813's live-proof escalation: no
// non-vendor khatru hook point exists for the raw NIP-42 AUTH envelope
// failure without hand-patching vendored khatru, which that item's scope
// forbade — accepted descope mallcoppro-a26). It is still mapped here
// (defensively, alongside unauthorized_writer, which DOES fire in prod) in
// case a future relay change wires it in — it is squarely an
// authorization-boundary failure (a failed proof-of-identity), not a
// usage/billing signal, so it stays in scope even though the KEEP list this
// item was scoped against only calls out unauthorized_writer by name; today
// it will simply never appear in a live query result.

// gate literal ("login_failure") so a repeated-rejection burst from the same

// membership change — see nip86AdminIsAllowlistChange below). Every other
// relay_security decision produces NO Result:
//
//   - rate_limited / nip09_tombstone / balance_gate_rejected are USAGE/billing
//     signals (a paying client hit its rate cap, a paid tombstone was
//     accepted, a request was rejected for insufficient balance) — not
//     infrastructure subversion — and are dropped ENTIRELY (mallcoppro-f1a
//     re-scope): no Result, not even the inert CatchAll, so this connector's
//     output is exclusively authorization-boundary events.
//   - a nip86_admin_call whose method is not a write-allowlist grant/revoke
//     (e.g. "supportedmethods", "listallowedpubkeys", or any method name a
//     caller invents) is not a security-config change either and is also
//     dropped.
//   - a genuinely UNRECOGNIZED decision string (a future seclog.Decision* the
//     relay adds before this connector is updated) still falls through to
//     CatchAll rather than being silently dropped — that is the one case
//     where "we don't know what this is yet" should still reach the
//     type-less detectors, as distinct from "we know exactly what this is
